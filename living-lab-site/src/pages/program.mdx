# Program Overview

Our program is driven by a bold goal: to elevate STEM education by implementing and evaluating the transformative potential of Living Labs. We propose a Living Lab of AI Systems for Health, called AIHealth-LL, as a pioneering solution to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, while also fostering essential professional skills and stronger connections with industry. AIHealth-LL will (i) serve as a national model of experiential learning of STEM training in this area while (ii) addressing the major shortage of highly qualified professionals who can create and maintain AI systems for the health domain.

## Training Components 

AIHealth-LL achieves several novel and original training components:
- Living lab internships where participants will be offered the opportunity to serve one or more projects.
- New developed courses on Artificial Intelligence Applied to Health, Engineering AI-based Software Systems, and Ethical Issues and Regulatory Requirements.
Industry webinar and/or on-site seminars.
- Annual Workshop on AI Systems for Health in which participants will enhance their leadership and professional skills, where they can showcase their projects, raise awareness of the field, and engage with invited professors and leaders from other universities and community colleges during a dedicated program presentation session.
- Hands-on leadership and mentorship training where trainees will be coached on how to critically evaluate AI-based software systems, related projects and publications.

## Why the Health Domain?

The health-tech sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, evidenced by record funding levels—$29.1 billion in 2021 alone—and a 
market that is projected to continue expanding in the coming years. The median valuation for health-tech companies surged by 67% 
from 2021 to 2022, reaching over $57 million, significantly higher than the 2021 median of $33.9 million and those of previous years. 
Furthermore, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 16% growth in demand for health informatics professionals from 2022 to 2032, 
a rate much faster than the average for all occupations.

The future of health technology is based on artificial intelligence (AI) based systems that can analyze and process data, learn from 
experience, and make informed decisions, in essence mimicking human-like intelligence. In a report recently published in 2024, the World 
Economic Forum pointed out that “AI will revolutionize healthcare delivery, generate groundbreaking advances in health research and contribute 
to better health for all.” However, in spite of all the excitement around AI in healthcare, there are many concerns that must be addressed. 
AI algorithms, for example, can exacerbate biases in healthcare. Given the increasing use of AI in healthcare, careful review and continual 
development of best practices for supporting the development of such systems are essential to maximize benefits and mitigate harm. A new 
generation of computer scientists needs to be prepared for this new exciting and challenging scenario.

Given the rapid growth and transformative potential of the health-tech sector, particularly with the increasing integration of AI systems 
in healthcare, we have chosen the health domain. It presents a unique and critical opportunity to explore how Living Labs can bridge the 
gap between academic knowledge and real-world application, while addressing the urgent need for professionals equipped to develop and deploy 
AI technologies in healthcare responsibly.
